### How to use
~~Create 2 env variables with the keys of `tokens` and `domains`. `tokens` needs to be a comma separated list (not including spaces) of tokens you wish to use for your CDN. They can be anything - from email addresses to usernames to random words. `domains` needs to be a comma separated list (yet again - no spaces) of domains that point to your Repl. They don't have to be linked, they can be forwarded (as a page rule, etc), however it's probably a good idea to have one domain linked and point the others to that domain.~~

Fork the storage repl by clicking this button [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/shard-pictures/repldb-cdn-storage)](https://repl.it/github/shard-pictures/repldb-cdn-storage), and then visit the dashboard [here](https://shard.pictures/). Log in with Replit, and download your ShareX config.
